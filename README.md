- `data/`: Contains the training, validation, and test datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and development.
- `models/`: Trained models.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, model definition, and training scripts.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## How to Run

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run script
