# Is it a pneumonia ?

This project aims to develop an AI model using PyTorch to classify lung X-ray images as either healthy or having pneumonia.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the training, validation, and test datasets.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, model definition, and training scripts.
- `my-app`: front-end.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
-  `start.sh`: Start script.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (here ^^).

## How to Run

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run script
    ```bash
    sh start.sh
